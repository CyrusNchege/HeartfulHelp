# HeartfulHelp - A Fundraising platform

## The idea behind is to create a platform where people can raise funds for a cause.(e.g. medical bills, helping the needy, etc)

I did this project to learn Django and also improve in integrating third party APIs.

## Features
- Users can create an account and login (by username and password) or login using Google
- Logged In Users can create a fundraise cause
- Users can donate to a fundraise cause and also leave a comment even if they have not logged in
- None members can only view fundraisers and donate to them but they cannot create fundraisers  or edit them
- Users can edit their fundraisers
- Those who donate can trigger payment using Mpesa STK push
- After payment is complete the ammount is added to the fundraiser's total amount and it is reflected on the page

## Technologies used
- Django
- Jinja templating language
- Bootstrap
- Javascript
- Mpesa API
- AWS
